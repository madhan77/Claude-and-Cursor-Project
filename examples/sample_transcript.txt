Product Owner: Good morning everyone. Today we need to discuss the new user authentication feature for our mobile app.

Developer: Sure, what are the requirements?

Product Owner: We need to implement a secure login system with email and password. Users should be able to register, login, reset their password, and logout.

QA Lead: What about password requirements? Should we enforce complexity rules?

Product Owner: Yes, passwords must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.

Developer: Got it. What about the password reset flow?

Product Owner: Users should receive a password reset link via email. The link should expire after 24 hours. Once they click the link, they can enter a new password.

QA Lead: Should we implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts?

Product Owner: Yes, excellent point. After 5 failed login attempts, the account should be locked for 30 minutes.

Developer: What about session management? How long should a user stay logged in?

Product Owner: The session should expire after 24 hours of inactivity. But we should also provide a "Remember Me" option that keeps the user logged in for 30 days.

QA Lead: What about email validation during registration?

Product Owner: Yes, users should receive a verification email when they register. They must click the verification link before they can login.

Developer: Should we support social login like Google or Facebook?

Product Owner: Not in the first version. Let's keep it simple with email/password only. We can add social login in a future release.

QA Lead: What error messages should we show for various scenarios?

Product Owner: Let's be user-friendly. For login failures, just show "Invalid email or password" - don't reveal which one is wrong for security reasons. For registration, show specific errors like "Email already exists" or "Password doesn't meet requirements".

Developer: Any specific requirements for the UI?

Product Owner: The login and registration forms should be clean and simple. Include clear labels, placeholder text, and inline validation that shows errors as the user types.

QA Lead: I'll make sure to test all edge cases including SQL injection attempts, XSS attacks, and brute force scenarios.

Product Owner: Perfect. This is a critical security feature so thorough testing is essential.
